# Smart Door

This App is part of Smart Door senior, which provides makers with free, open-source components for effortless interfacing with devices and services that makers use most to hack their homes.

## Why?

Home security systems are a growing field of projects for Makers. A self-built system is less expensive than a bulky professional installation, but it also allows for total control and customization to suit your needs.
