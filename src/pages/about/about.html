            This App is part of Smart Door senior, which provides makers with free, open-source
            components for effortless interfacing with devices and services that makers use most to hack their homes.

        <p>
            Home security systems are a growing field of projects for Makers. A self-built system is not only less
            expensive than a bulky professional installation, but it also allows for total control and customization to
            suit your needs.
